### FEND Arcade Game

A Frogger Arcade Game made with *JavaScript* and focus on *object-oriented* code. The purpose of the game is to get to the water without hitting the bugs on the way (just like Frogger).


### How to play

If you want to run the game locally, [download or clone](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git) the project files before opening the index.html file in your preferred browser (which should be Chrome :)) You play the game by using your keyboard arrows. Stay clear of the bugs, and try to reach the water!


### Game Rules 

Do your best, this is just for fun!
